# BookInventorySystem
## Description 
In this assignment, you are required to build a C++ system (excluding Class and its related libraries). 
The focus of this assignment is to strengthen your Array, Data Structure, String Manipulation, write 
and read data files, Pointers (All defined variables must be represented as pointer type, int, char etc)
concepts.
## Senario
A book shop PRIMER BOOKSHOP SDN BHD wants to maintain the inventory of books that are being 
sold at the shop. The list includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. 
Whenever a customer wants a book, the sales personnel inputs the title and author and the system
searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. 
- If it is not, an appropriate message is displayed. 
- If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests for the number of 
copies required. 
- If the requested copies book details and requests for the number of copies required 
available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed and your system needs 
to update the database.
- Sales personnel, from time to time is allowed to update the latest stock and price to 
the created database. 
Design a system using a C++ called books inventory with suitable member functions, array, data 
structure and pointers. Use suitable pointers, array and data structure to allocate and handle your 
memory space required dynamically. User can also save theirs searching process data and can be 
opened soon by certain ID / key to index their previous searching process data. 
For the menu, at least you could come out with the following menu system. Subject to your 
creativity, you may add as many function as you could to ensure that your system maintains very 
good interactivity.
